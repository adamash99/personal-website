            <h2>Would the Kardashian-Jenner sisters (or rather, their exes) contend in the modern NBA?</h2>

            <p id="blog-paragraph">Like most reasonable Americans, I am proud of the fact that I do not know what the Kardashians are up to.
                In fact, it was only because of research for this article (and the guidance of my friend and resident Kardashian expert Talia)
                that I learned the difference between the Kardashians and the Jenners. However, I do follow sports enough to accidently know that the Kardashians have been involved with numerous
                (to say the least) athletes. Over the last few years, the occasional <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cdhu01/how_good_of_a_lineup_is_allkardashian_team"> reddit post</a>
                or <a href="https://brobible.com/sports/article/kendall-jenners-ex-beat-chicago-bulls/">bro-blog clickbait article</a> 
                has popped up with mock analysis on the validity of a basketball team composed solely of former Kardashian love interests.
                Featuring perennial all stars such as James Harden and Ben Simmons, it is immediately clear that our "all exes" team is no slouch.
                It is less obvious if the exes have enough depth and flexibility to compete with the upper tier of current NBA contenders.
                I decided to take a closer look using advanced statistics to find out if this team would be a title threat.

            <p id="blog-paragraph">
                A couple things to note before we start - I'm using the current (2019-2020 season) versions of each player, 
                no matter when they dated a Kardashian and played in the NBA. So while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Odom">Lamar Odom</a>
                or even <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-goes-on-date-with-rick-fox-2015275/">Rick Fox</a> 
                would technically be eligible to suit up, I doubt they would be much help getting back on defense anymore.
                Maybe they can form our hypothetical coaching staff. Also, players must have actually dated a Kardashian/Jenner. 
                A TMZ post of a Kendall Jenner just hanging out with someone isn't going to cut it. For a basketball player to qualify, 
                I needed to find an article that actually confirms a relationship.  Sorry <a href = "https://www.glamour.com/story/kendall-jenner-kyle-kuzma-dating-rumors">Kuz</a>.

            <p id="blog-paragraph">Doing research to find out which current NBA players have dated a Kardashian
                was perhaps the most painful experience of my life. But in the end, I found 8 NBA 
                players we can work with, enough for a functional rotation. It seems like we are a bit 
                weak on rim protection, but are definitely not lacking any ball handling or scoring punch. 
                Our big man depth is a bit thin, but that won't matter as much as it would in real life since 
                even Blake Griffin can't get injured in a simulation.

            <p id = "section-marker">The Math</p>
            <p id="blog-paragraph">
                To calculate the projected statistics and winning percentages for our team,
                I used 538's RAPTOR metric. Essentially, RAPTOR is a computed statistic that measures 
                "the number of points a player contributes to his team's offense and defense per 100 possessions, 
                relative to a league-average player." Each player has an offensive RAPTOR rating, a defensive RAPTOR rating, 
                and a total RAPTOR rating, which is just the sum of the first two. You can check out the gory details behind RAPTOR
                <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-raptor-metric-works/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p id="blog-paragraph">
                Once I calculated each players projections per 100 possessions, I needed to 
                figure out how many minutes per game each player would contribute. To do this, I 
                normalized each players 2019-2020 average MPG over 240, which is the total number 
                of minutes per team played in a non-overtime NBA game. Each player is projected to 
                play only about 30 seconds more per game on the exes team than with their real life teams, 
                so this change shouldn't impact the RAPTOR ratings. Then, assuming our team plays at 
                the 2019-2020 league average pace of 101 possessions per game, I calculated each players projected 
                net contribution per game on offense, on defense, and overall. You can see the 
                results in the table below.

                Next, I took the average of each of our players RAPTOR ratings, weighted by playing
                 time, to calculate how the team differs against an average NBA team. Unsurprisingly,
                  our James Harden and Devin Booker led offense utterly dominates - the exes would
                   score about 120.16 points per game, or 8.36 PPG better than the average team.
                    For context, the Milwaukee Bucks offense led the NBA in 2019-20 at 118.7 PPG. 
                    Our defense, on the other hand, is not as effective. The rotation here projects
                     to give up a bit more than 3 points per game than average, which comes out to
                      about 115 PPG. This is about what the Warriors' 24th ranked defense did in 2019-20.
            </p>
            <p id="blog-paragraph">
                Against an average NBA team, the exes would be projected to win by 5 points. 
                Using this projection and assuming an average strength of schedule, I took the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_expectation">pythagorean expectation </a>
                 with the same constants used by 538 to estimate a winning percentage of 64%, which comes 
                 out to 53 wins over an 82 game season. Not too shabby at all, but not exactly the '96 Bulls.
            </p>
            <p id ="section-marker">So, will we be seeing a title parade in Calabasas anytime soon?</p>
            <p id="blog-paragraph">
                538's RAPTOR ratings say that  a team with 53 regular season wins should 
                have around a 6% chance at making the finals and a 3% chance at winning it all. 
                This is a bit lower than I expected just by looking at the roster. A "Death Lineup" 
                of Harden, Booker, D'Angelo Russell, Blake Griffin, and Ben Simmons at center seems like 
                it would be able to eviscerate most team's closing groups. On the other hand, our team is 
                a bit empty when it comes to defensive wings, which is certainly reflected in our total defensive 
                RAPTOR ratings. However, RAPTOR does not account for players bouncing back from injuries. Things could 
                look much different next season if Blake Griffin and Chandler Parsons return to form. Still, it 
                would probably take an all star caliber forward replacing Parsons to push this team over the top. 
                Depending on how Kendall Jenner's offseason plays out, we could see a new favorite for the 2020-2021 season.
