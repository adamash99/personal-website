            <h1 >Katch and Shoot: The Greatest Basketball Team Never Assembled </h1>
            <h2>Would the Kardashian-Jenner sisters (or rather, their exes) contend in the modern NBA?</h2>
            <h3>August 19, 2020</h3>
            <br>
            <p id="blog-paragraph">Like most reasonable Americans, I am proud of the fact that I do not know what the Kardashians are up to.
                In fact, it was only because of research for this article (and the guidance of my friend and resident Kardashian expert Talia)
                that I learned the difference between the Kardashians and the Jenners. However, I do follow sports enough to accidently know that the Kardashians have been involved with numerous
                (to say the least) athletes. Over the last few years, the occasional <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cdhu01/how_good_of_a_lineup_is_allkardashian_team"> reddit post</a>
                or <a href="https://brobible.com/sports/article/kendall-jenners-ex-beat-chicago-bulls/">bro-blog clickbait article</a> 
                has popped up with mock analysis on the validity of a basketball team composed solely of former Kardashian love interests.
                Featuring perennial all stars such as James Harden and Ben Simmons, it is immediately clear that our "all exes" team is no slouch.
                It is less obvious if the exes have enough depth and flexibility to compete with the upper tier of current NBA contenders.
                I decided to take a closer look using advanced statistics to find out if this team would be a title threat.

                A couple things to note before we start - I'm using the current (2019-2020 season) versions of each player, 
                no matter when they dated a Kardashian and played in the NBA. So while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Odom">Lamar Odom</a>
                or even <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-goes-on-date-with-rick-fox-2015275/">Rick Fox</a> 
                would technically be eligible to suit up, I doubt they would be much help getting back on defense anymore.
                Maybe they can form our hypothetical coaching staff. Also, players must have actually dated a Kardashian/Jenner. 
                A TMZ post of a Kendall Jenner just hanging out with someone isn't going to cut it. For a basketball player to qualify, 
                I needed to find an article that actually confirms a relationship.  Sorry <a href = "https://www.glamour.com/story/kendall-jenner-kyle-kuzma-dating-rumors">Kuz</a>.
