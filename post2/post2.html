                <p id="blog-paragraph">In one of the less expected developments of Summer 2020, 
                    I started working out everyday before breakfast. Honestly, it feels weird 
                    just to write those words out. And as part of the routine most mornings, I've 
                    been making myself a breakfast burrito directly afterwards. At the beginning of 
                    my workout/burrito journey, I 
                    <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Sm_umARa0">looked up</a> 
                    how to roll a burrito the "professional" way, like at an actual restaurant.

                <p id="blog-paragraph">
                    Depending a little on how hungry I am and a lot on how long its been since my 
                    last Trader Joe's trip, I  put different fillings in different amounts in my burritos. 
                    There could be eggs, avocado, turkey bacon, peppers, tomatoes, etc. You know, basic 
                    breakfast burrito stuff. Anyway, I noticed that unfortunately, I often overstuffed my 
                    burrito. Despite my best efforts, I wouldn't be able to properly close the tortilla and 
                    sometimes (gasp) the burrito would come apart as I worked my way through it. If this has 
                    ever happened to you, you know that it is a disaster of proportions so epic that 
                    something must be done. But what?
                </p>
                <p id = "section-marker"> The Objective </p>
                <p id="blog-paragraph">
                    At first, I had a lot of questions. It seemed like the hypothtical answer for 
                    every question would lead to even more questions, and I'll spew some of these questions out here
                    if you are interested. At first, I was curious how  burrito size changes relative to what you put in?
                    What is the optimal size for the burrito? What percentage of tortilla is squashed at bottom when you fold differently? How 
                    does changing your parameters impact this? What should each of these parameters even be in the first place?
                    What is the optimal combination of parameters? Is it achievable? How would one go about acieving this? Would a different tortilla shape be better?
                    Does it even matter how you fold?
                </p>
                <p id="blog-paragraph">
                    Obviously, I had to pare down these questions. While many or all of them would be potentially
                    fascinating (at least to me) to answer, I had to start somewhere. So I settled on one simple goal,
                    and decided to maybe leave the rest for future blog posts. I settled on the question of how to maximize the amount
                    of food that I could fit into the burrito without it coming apart. I wanted to do this
                    starting with the folding method shown in the video above. If I find a better method along the 
                    way, fantastic! I'll switch to that. If possible, I also wanted to
                    minimize the amount of bunched up the tortilla at each end of the burrito. It 
                    turns out that those goals are one and the same. More on that in a bit.

                <p id = "section-marker">First, a few assumptions</p>
                <p id="blog-paragraph">
                    Before I jump in with the math, I want to clarify a few of my underlying assumptions about
                    the math behind the burrito. First, we are going to assume that each tortilla is a perfect circle. We are also
                    going to assume that once the burrito is folded, it takes the shape of a cylinder. Finally, we
                    assume that the tortilla is 2 dimensional. Since tortillas are pretty thin anyway (although definitely 3D objects)
                    this won't impact my final results too much.
